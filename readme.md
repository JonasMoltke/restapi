### Problem to solve:
Please implement the 4 API endpoints mentioned above, in the language you consider fit for the purpose.

### Autoloader
Under normal circumstances i would make use of autoloader instead of include the classes, but as this project was made "on the run", i didn't have the chance to setup a local test server.

### General testing
It's important to notice that this is not fully working. There's still missing a bit of logic to make the whole thing complete and the Laravel part is not setup, just "thinked in". Nothing here is tested, because of a little lack of time and to repeat myself, made on the run.
